The purpose of this package is to allow shape constraints for GBDT models

To implement this behavior the user must be able to specify relationships among
values of an input variable and the target variable

These relationships can be relative to each other:

  -1 must always be higher than nan, for example

And they can be absolute w.r.t. to the target:

  -1 must always be the highest followed by nan, followed by the rest

Further, the user should be able to specify that certain intervals are
monotonic for

nan, -99, -1, 0 to 10, 11 to 20, 999

     nan: < -1
     -99: highest
      -1: < 0 to 10
 0 to 10: mono inc
11 to 20: mono dec
     999: lowest

How to rearrange these?

Step 1
Map these to real values, considering on range at a time

999
nan
-1
0 to 10  : get the min/max of target range
11 to 20
-99

Step 2

Considering range 0 to 10
min: 0, max: 10

renumber values around the actual range

-3: 999
-2: nan
-1: -1
0 to 10
11 to 20: 11
-99: 12


y:  0,  1,  2, 3.....4,  5,  6
x: -3, -2, -1, 0 to 10, 11, 12

## simply reverse the values?
y:  0,  1,  2, 4.....3,  5,  6
x: -3, -2, -1, 0 to 10, 11, 12
